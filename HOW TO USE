The requirement for this Python project is a webcam through which we will capture images. You need to have python 3.7 installed on your system, then using pip, you can install the necessary packages.

Project Prerequisites:-

OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).
TensorFlow – pip install tensorflow (keras uses TensorFlow as backend).
Keras – pip install keras (to build our classification model).
Pygame – pip install pygame (to play alarm sound).

If tensorflow doesn't work , create the python virtual environment and install the tensorflow and all the neccessary packages.

For Facial recognition of the driver , a sample image should placed in the driver_images folder with the respective driver's name.

A predefined trained dataset is used in this project , however you can also use alternative dataset which can be downloaded from the link given below :-
